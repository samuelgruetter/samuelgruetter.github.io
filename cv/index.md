## Research Experience

| C Live Verification | A framework for proving correctness of programs in a C-like language (Bedrock2). The user writes the program and the proof at the same time, aided by a real-time display of the program’s current symbolic state [[PLDI'24](https://doi.org/10.1145/3656439)] |
| Bedrock2 end-to-end | I wrote a compiler from a simple C-like language to RISC-V machine code, proved it correct in the Coq proof assistant, and used it to prove end-to-end system correctness theorems covering whole software-hardware stacks [PLDI'21 &amp; '24] |
| C information flow | I was visiting Dr. Toby Murray at the University of Melbourne for 10 weeks to work on information flow control proofs for C [PLAS'17] |
| Verifying AES | For a six months master thesis internship, I was working with Prof. Andrew Appel’s group at Princeton, improving the proof automation tactics of their Verified Software Toolchain, and using it to verify AES encryption |
| DOT | During my master’s at EPFL, I was working with Prof. Martin Odersky’s Scala lab on the Dependent Object Types project, a formalization of the core of Scala’s type system, writing proofs on paper and in Twelf and Coq |
| Leon termination | For a class project at EPFL, I contributed to the function termination checker of Leon, a tool for verification and synthesis of Scala programs by Prof. Viktor Kuncak’s group |
| Dotty | While working at the Scala lab, I contributed to dotty, a new Scala compiler serving as a research platform to investigate new language concepts and compiler technologies for Scala |
| Structural Types | For my bachelor thesis, I designed, explored and implemented a simple structurally typed language in PLT redex |

## Industry Internships

| Google, 2021 | In the Silver Oak Project, used Bedrock2 to formally verify drivers for peripherals used in the OpenTitan root of trust, and connected software correctness proofs to hardware correctness proofs |
| Amazon ARG, 2019 | Worked with Rustan Leino at Amazon's Automated Reasoning Group on a prototype rewrite of Amazon's S3 Encryption Client in Dafny, a verification-aware programming language. Wrote and proved specifications for software interacting with real-world systems such as Amazon's S3 storage service |
| Netcetera, 2015 | 6 months Software Engineering Internship at Netcetera AG, Berne, working in a scrum team, developing an expert tool for defining and maintaining the fare zones and ticket pricing for all Swiss public transport associations, with a Java/​Oracle DB/Spring backend and an AngularJS frontend in JavaScript/TypeScript |
| Accenture, 2012  | Java Summer Internship at Accenture in Bangalore (India), developed a web interface with JSF/Enterprise JavaBeans monitoring servers and databases |
