title:  '"How to" attend a conference'
---

In my first year as a PhD student, I was fortunate enough to attend four conferences: [CCS'17](https://ccs2017.sigsac.org/), [POPL'18](https://popl18.sigplan.org/), [PLDI'18](https://pldi18.sigplan.org/), and [FLoC'18](https://www.floc2018.org/) (thanks to [Toby Murray](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/) and three thanks to [Adam Chlipala](adam.chlipala.net) for the funding!).

Attending a conference can be quite overwhelming, and it is not always clear to me how to get the most out of it. However, I think I've learned a lot about this in the past year, and I'm very excited to share it here on my blog.
